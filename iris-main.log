INTERSYSTEMS IRIS WRITE IMAGE JOURNALING RESTORE:
There are disk blocks that were not written by InterSystems IRIS when it was
last running with this InterSystems IRIS Manager Directory.  Those blocks are
in the Write Image File, and you can write them now.  If you do not
write those blocks, you will probably have database degradation.
You cannot start InterSystems IRIS until you delete this file, so you will
probably want to write the blocks now and then delete this file.

Is an operator present to answer questions (Y/N)? Y => 
Do you want to write them now (Y/N)? Y =>
